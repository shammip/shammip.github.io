What do you plan to do this week?

Are there any impediments in your way?
* I don’t want to forget previous week’s material but reviewing that material weekly might take more time than I had anticipated.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Last week, I updated my website using GitHub Pages Markdown and I found that it was much easier than relearning HTML. At this point, I have included the necessary information that is required for my website. Moving forward, I will only need to update my website with the weekly updates and the final report.
* Last week, I learned the chapter’s material over 2 days and that helped me to understand the material better because there wasn’t an overload of information. I’m hoping to continue this practice moving forward.
