    <h3>Weekly Update:</h3><br>
    
    <p1>What did you do last week?

    <li>Wrote a project proposal</li>
    <li>Completed LeetCode - Introduction: wrote notes</li>
    <li>Wrote a weekly update</li>

    <li>Complete LeetCode - Arrays and Strings: write notes, complete practice problems, take quiz</li>
    <li>Write a weekly update</li> 
    <li>Relearn HTML & update my website</li>
    
    Are there any impediments in your way?
    <li>I hope there is enough time for me to complete the current chapter and relearn HTML this week.</li>
    
    Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
    <li>Last week, I completed this course’s work prior to starting my other course’s work. This method helped me to focus on each course with much depth - I believe that I will continue to practice this method.</li>
    <li>Writing notes while reading the chapter on Introduction really helped me to understand the Big O and Recursion concepts better - I can try to read the material first and then write notes based on what I remember so that I can reflect on which concepts I understand and which ones I need to work on. </li><br></p1>
