### LeetCode Course Notes 

**Introduction to Big O:** 
* big O: an algorithmâ€™s computational complexity 
* time complexity: how much time does the algorithm take? 
* space complexity: how much memory does the algorithm take? 
* constants are ignored 
* best complexity is O(1) / constant time / constant space 
* three cases: best case scenario (unlikely to use this one), average case scenario, worst case scenario
* logarithmic time: ex. O(log n)

**Introduction to Recursion:** 
* iterative algorithm: use for and while loops for repetition 	
* recursive algorithm: use function calls for repetition
