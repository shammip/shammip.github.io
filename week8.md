## Week 8: Greedy Algorithms

*July 10, 2023 - July 16, 2023*

### Status: 

What did you do last week?
* Wrote a weekly update
* Completed LeetCode - Heaps: wrote notes, successfully solved 2 practice problems, took quiz
* Completed half of a LinkedIn Learning course called Time Management Fundamentals
* Wrote a reflection on the LinkedIn Learning course

What do you plan to do this week?
* Write a mid-semester project update
* Complete second half of a LinkedIn Learning course called Time Management Fundamentals
* Write a weekly update
* Complete LeetCode - Greedy Algorithms: write notes, solve practice problems, take quiz

Are there any impediments in your way?
* None

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* I haven’t really changed my process in the last few weeks so I will just continue to focus on working on LeetCode before working on my other course.

### Mid-Semester Project Update:

Project Reflection:
* This project has allowed me to learn various data structures and how to apply them to practice problems. I also learned many patterns to be mindful of when solving problems.

Completed Goals:
* I have completed the following chapters per week as outlined in my project: Introduction, Array & Strings, Hashmaps & Sets, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues, Trees & Graphs, Heaps
* I have completed one half of a LinkedIn Learning course on Time Management. The second half will take a few hours to complete because it is more hands-on but I’m planning on working on it this week.

Future Goals:
* I plan to complete the following chapters per week: Greedy Algorithms, Binary Search, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Interview & Tools & Bonus
* I have also planned mock interviews with fellow classmates from July 28-30.
