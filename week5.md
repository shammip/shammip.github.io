*June 19, 2023 - June 25, 2023*

### Status Update 

What did you do last week?

What do you plan to do this week?
* Write a weekly update
* Complete LeetCode - Stacks and Queues: write notes, solve practice problems, take quiz

Are there any impediments in your way?
* I have an exam this week so I will complete the exam first and then work on this week’s material.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* On Day 1, I reviewed previous weeks’ material and started reading up on Linked Lists. And then on Day 2, I practiced some problems. This method really helped me to remember previous weeks’ material. I will continue this strategy moving forward.
