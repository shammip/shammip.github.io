## Week 3: Hashmaps and Sets

*June 5, 2023 - June 11, 2023*

### Status Update 

What did you do last week?
* Wrote a weekly update
* Updated website using HTML
* Completed LeetCode - Arrays and Strings: wrote notes, solved 6 practice problems, took a quiz (80%)

What do you plan to do this week?
* Write a weekly update
* Update website using GitHub Pages Markdown
* Complete LeetCode - Hashmaps and Sets: write notes, solve practice problems, take quiz

Are there any impediments in your way?
* I have decided to update my website based on GitHub Pages Markdown so I will need to learn this and it will take some time.
* It would be a good idea to incorporate review sessions every week so that I donâ€™t forget the material that I have learned so far.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Initially, I was using HTML to update my website, however, I realized that I was spending way too much time in relearning it. So I checked if using GitHub Pages Markdown was easier than HTML in updating my website and it is. Therefore, I have decided to use Markdown to update my website.
* It took 6 hours in one day to complete the chapter Arrays and Strings; this included writing notes, solving 6 practice problems and taking a quiz. I believe that I would benefit better by dividing the material and completing the work in sections so that I can review the material over the week.
