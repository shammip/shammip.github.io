Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* When I didnâ€™t know how to solve a practice problem, I checked the solution after about 15 minutes and then tried to solve it the next day. This method really helped me to remember the material I had learned the previous day. I have used this strategy before and it seems to work so I will continue to use it moving forward.
