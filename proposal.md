## Project Proposal ##

**Title: Master DS & A**

**Vision Statement:** I would like to master data structures and algorithms in order to prepare for technical interviews.

**Motivation:** Technical interviews require a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms, which are essential in order to solve coding problems. I would like to be successful in getting an internship so preparing for technical interviews would be highly beneficial for me.

**Project Goal:** The primary goal of this project is for me to complete Leetcode’s Interview Crash Course: Data Structures and Algorithms. The course material will contain readings, videos, practice problems, and quizzes.

The course is divided into 13 chapters, which I will learn on a weekly basis, except for the last two chapters, which I will condense into one week. The schedule is below:

* Week 1: Introduction
* Week 2: Arrays and Strings
* Week 3: Hashmaps and Sets
* Week 4: Linked Lists
* Week 5: Stacks and Queues
* Week 6: Trees and Graphs
* Week 7: Heaps
* Week 8: Greedy Algorithms
* Week 9: Binary Search
* Week 10: Backtracking
* Week 11: Dynamic Programming
* Week 12: Interview and Tools, Bonus

For weekly goals, see Project Assessments. 

**Risks:**
* Not dedicating enough time each week to cover the topic.
* Not understanding the material that is covered.
* Having trouble solving the practice problems.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Since working on this course is very important for me to get an internship, I propose to complete this course before moving on to my other course each week.
* If I have trouble understanding the material then I will use other resources that might be helpful, such as YouTube videos and asking for help on LeetCode's chat server, Piazza, and Student Meet Up Hours. 
* If I have trouble solving the practice problems then I will ask for help on LeetCode's chat server, Piazza, and Student Meet Up Hours.

**Project Assessments:**
* I will create weekly notes on the current week’s topic.
* I will practice the assigned problems that are associated with each topic.
* I will take the end of topic quiz, with a goal of achieving 80% or higher in order to demonstrate that I have learned the topic successfully.
