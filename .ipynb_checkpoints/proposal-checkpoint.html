    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h3>Title: Master DS & A</h3>
    <h3>Vision Statement:</h3> 
    <p3>I would like to master data structures and algorithms in order to prepare for technical interviews.</p3>
    <h3>Motivation:</h3>  
    <p3>Technical interviews require a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms, which are essential in order to solve coding problems. I would like to be successful in getting an internship so preparing for technical interviews would be highly beneficial for me.</p3>
    <h3>Project Goal:</h3> 
    <p3>The primary goal of this project is for me to complete Leetcode’s Interview Crash Course: Data Structures and Algorithms. The course material will contain readings, videos, practice problems, and quizzes.</p3><br>
    <p3>The course is divided into 13 chapters, which I will learn on a weekly basis, except for the last two chapters, which I will condense into one week. The schedule is below:<br>
- Week 1: Introduction<br>
- Week 2: Arrays and Strings<br>
- Week 3: Hashmaps and Sets<br>
- Week 4: Linked Lists<br>
- Week 5: Stacks and Queues<br>
- Week 6: Trees and Graphs<br>
- Week 7: Heaps<br>
- Week 8: Greedy Algorithms<br>
- Week 9: Binary Search<br>
- Week 10: Backtracking<br>
- Week 11: Dynamic Programming<br>
- Week 12: Interview and Tools, Bonus<br>
For weekly goals, see Project Assessments. </p3><br>
    <h3>Risks:</h3>
    <p3>1. Not dedicating enough time each week to cover the topic.<br>
2. Not understanding the material that is covered.<br>
3. Having trouble solving the practice problems.</p3><br>
    <h3>Mitigation Strategies:</h3>
    <p3>1. Since working on this course is very important for me to get an internship, I propose to complete this course before moving on to my other course each week.<br>
2. If I have trouble understanding the material then I will use other resources that might be helpful, such as YouTube videos and asking for help on LeetCode's chat server, Piazza, and Student Meet Up Hours.<br>
3. If I have trouble solving the practice problems then I will ask for help on LeetCode's chat server, Piazza, and Student Meet Up Hours.</p3><br>
    <h3>Project Assessments:</h3>
    <p3>- I will create weekly notes on the current week’s topic.<br>
- I will practice the assigned problems that are associated with each topic.<br>
- I will take the end of topic quiz, with a goal of achieving 80% or higher in order to demonstrate that I have learned the topic successfully.<br></p3>
