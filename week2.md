## Week 2: Arrays and Strings 

*May 29, 2023 - June 4, 2023*

### Status Update

What did you do last week?
* Created a GitHub Pages website
* Wrote a project proposal 
* Completed LeetCode - Introduction: wrote notes
* Wrote a weekly update

What do you plan to do this week?
* Complete LeetCode - Arrays and Strings: write notes, complete practice problems, take quiz 
* Write a weekly update
* Relearn HTML & update my website

Are there any impediments in your way?
* I hope there is enough time for me to complete the current chapter and relearn HTML this week.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Last week, I completed this course’s work prior to starting my other course’s work. This method helped me to focus on each course with much depth - I believe that I will continue to practice this method.
* Writing notes while reading the chapter on Introduction really helped me to understand the Big O and Recursion concepts better - I can try to read the material first and then write notes based on what I remember so that I can reflect on which concepts I understand and which ones I need to work on.
